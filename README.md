# DSA_List_Complexity_Assignment
This repository contains the codes of the list complexity assignment for the course "Data Structure and Algorithms" in my year two at The African Leadership University in Rwanda.


### The prompt is as the following:

1. Implement a basic measure of tracking the time taken to run an algorithm.
2. Implement a basic measure of tracking the space used by an algorithm.
3. Implement the following 3 algorithms:
    a. Find the maximum value in a list 
    b. Make each letter in a string lowercase
    c.Sort a list of integers (using the inbuilt python method)

4. For each of the above algorithms, plot graphs showing how the time and space taken as the input size changes from length 1 to length 100. (Lengths of lists and lengths of strings). You donâ€™t need all values - just a few (e.g. 3) is enough.

5. **Estimate** how long each algorithm would take for inputs of size 1,000,000. Write your estimate clearly in the code.
